# Fashion-MNIST
Building a Deep Learning model to classify images related to fashion 

## Dataset 
The API the dataset is: kaggle datasets download -d zalando-research/fashionmnist  
<br>
This dataset contains two section:  
1.) Training Set : which contains 60,000 grayscale image of pixels (28,28)  
<tb> the images are of : top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat,
	sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, ankle boot  
2.) Test Set : which contains 10,000 grayscale images of pixel (28,28)
  
  
## Deep Learning Model created
I have created 2 models for this dataset  
1.) ANN - simply applied Artificial Neural Network  
<tb> We achieved an accuracy of 89% with this model
<br>
2.) CNN - achieved an accuracy of 93% with this model
